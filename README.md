## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Mobile-first workflow


### What I learned...

#### I learned about.

- Nesting HTML tags.

```HTML
<section class="wrapper">
<div class="main-content">
<img src="images/image-qr-code.png" alt="QR code to frontendmentor.com">
<h1>Improve your front-end skills by building projects</h1>
<p>Scan the QR code to visit Frontend Mentor and take your coding skills to the next level </p>
</div>
</section>
```
        
- Linking external font to a webpage using Google font.

````css
<link rel="preconnect" href="https://fonts.googleapis.com">
<link rel="preconnect" href="https://fonts.gstatic.com" crossorigin>
<link href="https://fonts.googleapis.com/css2?family=Outfit:wght@400;700&display=swap" rel="stylesheet">
````

- I also learned about combining the class selector to target HTML elements.

```css
    .wrapper {
        width: 260px;
        height: 400px;
        background-color: hsl(0, 0%, 100%);
        margin: 50px auto;
        border-radius: 15px;}
```
        

### Continued development

My focus now is to use the frontend mentor challenges to learn CSS properly and understand design layouts.

### Useful resources

- Google Fonts (https://fonts.google.com/) - This helped me select the Font-family and font weight that was specified to be used in the design. 

it's a really helpful tool.
